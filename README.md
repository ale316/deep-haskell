# Exercises in Deep Learning with Haskell

**Note: this is an early work in progress**

This repository contains toy implementations of all structures and algorithms appearing in Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville [Deep Learning book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/).

It is meant as a learning excercise.
